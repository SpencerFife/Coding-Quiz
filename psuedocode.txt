//the user is prompted to start the quiz using a "Start Quiz" button.

//once the user presses the "Start Quiz" button the timer starts.

//the page then resets and the timer begins.

//the first question is displayed and 4 options are given below it.

//if the user clicks on the correct answer the page says "correct" under the question set and then resets and 5 seconds is added to the timer.

//if the user clicks the wrong answer the page says "wrong" under the question set and then resets with a new question and the timer decreases by 15 seconds.

//this continues until either all the questions are answered OR the timer reaches 0 because the user has either run
out of time naturally OR they have answered too many wrong questions.

//once the timer reaches 0 the page resets with a page asking for the user to submit their initials.

//once the user has submited their initials the page resets with a score table consisting of the top
scores of each attempt at the quiz.

//the scores are static and are saved on the local storage of the page.


//there are 2 buttons on the highscore page, one "go back" button which will return the user to the main
page and one "clear highscores" button which will delete the highscores from the local storage.
